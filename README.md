# Neighborhood Map Project
This application was built for one of the course projects of the Udacity React Nanodegree Program that I took in 2017-2018. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the capability to build React application and the use of APIs.

Built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and API usage.

## How to Install and Run the App
The project uses Node.js. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, you can run the following command under the project root directory:
```
npm install
```
This will get all of the dependencies installed. Then you can launch the app using:
```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open and load the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser

## Production Mode
- To create a production build use `npm run build`
- Navigate to the build directory and start the server with `npm run deploy`
- This mode includes a Service Worker.

## How to Use the App
- A neighborhood map that marks a list of my lunch favorites in Oxford, OH is displayed upon loading of the application.
- There is also a list of the places on the page that a user can filter by entering a keyword in the name or food type of the restaurant. The map is updated real-time to reflect the filtered result.
- More information about each restaurant is showing up in a info window when a user clicked on the marker on the map, such as contact number, hours, price, ratings and a link to the restaurant's FourSquare page, where those information comes from.
